# Requirements

Before developing a message queue service for your application, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Memory**: Minimum 1GB RAM (2GB+ recommended for development)
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 1GB for full development environment
- **Internet Connection**: Required for downloading dependencies and testing with external queue services

## Core Prerequisites

### Python Version

- **Python**: Version 3.12 or higher (up to 3.13 supported)
- **Recommended**: Python 3.13 for optimal compatibility with async features

:::tip Python Installation
If you don't have Python installed:
- **macOS**: Use `brew install python` or download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
- **Linux**: Use your package manager (e.g., `apt install python3.13`)
- **Windows**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or use `winget install Python.Python.3.13`
:::

### Package Manager: uv (Required)

This template is specifically designed for **[uv]** - a fast, modern Python package manager written in Rust.

**Installation:**
```bash
# macOS and Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Alternative: via pip
pip install uv
```

**Why uv?**
- ⚡ **10-100x faster** than pip/poetry for dependency resolution
- 🔒 **Deterministic builds** with lockfile support  
- 🛠️ **All-in-one tool** for project management, virtual environments, and Python installation
- 📦 **Drop-in replacement** for pip with better dependency resolution

[uv]: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/

### Version Control

- **Git**: Version 2.20 or higher
- **GitHub Account**: For template creation and repository management (recommended)

## Application Integration

### Understanding the Target Application

To develop message queue services, you should understand:

- **Application Runtime**: The system that receives and dispatches events through your queue service
- **MessageQueueBackend Protocol**: The interface your service must implement
- **Plugin Discovery**: How the runtime finds and loads your message queue backend

### Development Dependencies

Your plugin will integrate with:

```toml
# Example: dependencies required by your application
dependencies = [
    "abstract-backend",  # Core runtime (replace with your application library)
]
```

## Message Queue Services (Optional)

Depending on your queue backend implementation, you may need access to:

### Local Development Services
- **Redis**: `brew install redis` (macOS) or `apt install redis-server` (Linux)
- **RabbitMQ**: `brew install rabbitmq` (macOS) or `apt install rabbitmq-server` (Linux)
- **Docker**: For containerized queue services

### Cloud Services
- **AWS Account**: For SQS, SNS integration
- **Google Cloud**: For Pub/Sub integration
- **Azure Account**: For Service Bus integration

## Development Tools (Auto-configured)

These tools are automatically set up in the template:

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- **pytest**: Async-capable testing framework
- **pytest-cov**: Code coverage reporting
- **pytest-asyncio**: Async test support
- **mypy**: Static type checking
- **black**: Code formatting
- **pylint**: Code linting

### Documentation
- **Docusaurus**: Documentation site generation
- **API documentation**: Auto-generated from docstrings

### CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and publishing
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Code quality enforcement

## Environment Setup Verification

After installing the prerequisites, verify your setup:

```bash
# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.12+

# Check uv installation
uv --version  # Should show uv version

# Check Git
git --version  # Should be 2.20+

# Verify you can create virtual environments
uv venv test-env
source test-env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or test-env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
deactivate
rm -rf test-env
```

## Next Steps

Once your environment meets these requirements, you're ready to:

1. 📋 **[Install the template](./installation)** - Clone and set up your plugin project
2. 🔧 **[Implement your backend](./how-to-run)** - Build your message queue logic
3. 🧪 **Test your service** - Validate integration with your application
4. 🚀 **Publish your package** - Share with the community

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Python Version Issues
```bash
# If you have multiple Python versions
uv python install 3.13
uv python pin 3.13
```

### uv Installation Issues
```bash
# If uv command not found after installation
source ~/.bashrc  # or restart terminal
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# If you get permission errors
uv venv --system-site-packages
```
